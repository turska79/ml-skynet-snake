# ml-skynet-snake

Snake game clone using SDL and Machine learning for my C++ practice purposes.

Snake game works and can be controlled with arrow keys. Space bar starts another game.

SDL Dependencies:
SDL2_image
SDL2_ttf
SDL2

Machine learning with Mlpack sort of works, but its still complete retard when "Ai" is
playing the game. Currently machine learning parts are on its on branch.

Machine learning Dependency:
MlPack

Game and code structure might be a bit overcomplicated for a simple game as a Snake
clone, but point was to make it well with object oriented style and using various
C++ features including some from C++ 17.
