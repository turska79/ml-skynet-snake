# ml-skynet-snake

Snake game clone using SDL and Machine learning for my C++ practice purposes.

Snake game works and can be controlled with arrow keys. Space bar starts another game.

SDL Dependencies:
SDL2_image
SDL2_ttf
SDL2

Machine learning with Mlpack sort of works, but its still complete retard when "Ai" is
playing the game.

Machine learning Dependency:
MlPack
